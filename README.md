This project implements a timer for a battery charger that needs to run 
on an infrequent schedule (such as once a month). It also has a button 
to run "now." This is useful for when you have something like a 
cordless drill or electric bicycle or other thing that you don't use 
every day, but still need to keep in a charged state.
